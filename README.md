âœ… Section 1: Python + Machine Learning

**Dataset:** Student Performance Dataset (Math & Portuguese)

ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
    - Load and clean the dataset (handle missing values, merge if needed).
    - Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.
    - Create a new column to label whether a student **Passes** or **Fails**.
    - Build a classification model using **Logistic Regression** or **Random Forest**.
    - Evaluate your model using:
      - Accuracy
      - Confusion Matrix
      - F1-score

**Note:** Use comments and markdown cells to explain each step clearly.

âœ… Section 3: Tableau

**Dataset:** Airbnb Listings in NYC

ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
    - Create a dashboard that includes:

âœ… Section 4: Excel

**Dataset:** Online Retail Dataset (UCI)

ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
    - Clean the data: remove null values and handle duplicates.
    - Create a pivot table showing **total sales by country and month**.
    - Use formulas to calculate:
      - **Average Order Value**
      - **% contribution** of each country to total sales
    - Highlight the **top-performing country** using conditional formatting.
